Based on the available factors the aim was to predict whether the student will be able to get admission in the university or not.

This was a group project and members are shared in the project report.

Initially, we did some exploratory data analysis and identified the correlations. Later we built a machine learning model.

We evaluated the performance of different models and identified the best model.

The code is also shared in the repository.
